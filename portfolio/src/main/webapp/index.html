                <p id="featured-desc">In 2020, myself and 3 other UNSW students built an AI to play a digital version of the popular board game Fury of Dracula. Since movement in the game is very complex we had to create a custom pathfinding method which we based off Dijkstra's algorithm. In each simulated game, the AI would use this pathfinding method to gain movement data, and along with the other information it was allowed to have (based on the rules), it would make a "best possible move" on every turn. Our team ended up placing 2nd out of over 50 teams.</p>
